## 🛠️ Technical — Claude to finish (top-to-bottom)

### Backend / processing pipeline
- [ ] Persist `uploads` + `verifications` rows after full processing (when Supabase configured)
- [ ] Store clean file in Supabase Storage; wire dashboard/history **Download** to signed URLs
- [ ] Enforce monthly **quota** (block + upgrade prompt when over allowance)
- [ ] Send **results-ready** email after processing + **receipt** email from webhook
- [ ] Move large-list processing to a **queue worker** (Inngest/QStash adapter)

### Public API
- [x] `POST /api/v1/verify` endpoint with API-key auth ✅
- [x] API key generation + management UI (settings) ✅

### Auth completeness
- [ ] Forgot / reset password flow
- [ ] Email-verification resend + confirmation handling
- [ ] Post-signup onboarding step

### Admin CRM depth
- [ ] User detail page (profile, subscription, usage, verification history)
- [ ] Admin actions: change plan, grant credit, suspend, refund
- [ ] Subscriptions / payments / referrals views
- [ ] Search + filter + pagination on lists

### App polish
- [x] Loading skeletons for app + admin ✅
- [ ] Team members management (Business plan)
- [ ] `app.bounceblock.io` subdomain routing (middleware host rewrite)

### Quality
- [x] More tests (plans, rate-limit) ✅ — 11 tests; add scoring/content-builder tests next
